Hardware E-commerce Website using Laravel 5.4

To get the project up and running on your local machine, do the following. I assume you already know how to go about laravel, bower composer and npm, so i'll be brief

- clone it => git clone https://github.com/boukhlif-projects/hardShopEcomm.git
- Run composer install, to install dependencies
- Run npm install to install npm dependencies
- Edit the created .env file at the root of your project, to add database credentials, etc
```bash
# download the database
[hardShopEcomm.sql => https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Lv_389Zt6zWkdBNGF2U1FxOE0
```
```bash
php artisan serve
```
- visit the site at localhost:8000

- NB# This is just an experimental project !!
